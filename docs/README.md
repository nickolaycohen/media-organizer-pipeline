| 6.2 | Export Status Report | CSV or HTML report of all curated assets, scoring, and publishing status | _(Planned)_   | ‚ùå Planned |

## üìÇ Step 2.1: Verify Smart Album (Manual)

Before proceeding with exporting photos:

- **Check that the Smart Album** corresponding to the current month batch (e.g., **April 2025**) **exists** in Apple Photos.
- If the Smart Album **does not exist**, the process will **stop** and display a message:  
  _"Smart Album for the current batch does not exist. Please create it manually in Apple Photos."_

Once the Smart Album is created, you can continue the process.

üí° You can run this script in dry-run mode to skip the AppleScript export and only verify existence:

> python3 scripts/verify_smart_album.py --dry-run

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Step 2.3.5 (`sync_photos_assets.py`) is a required step for syncing and enriching asset metadata before uploading to Google Photos.

## üìå Step 3.1.5 ‚Äì Pull Favorites from Google Photos

After Google Photos auto-curates memories and before manual review, this step pulls the list of media items marked as ‚≠ê Favorites in Google Photos.

- Downloads favorite status using the API
- Matches favorites to the assets in the local database (by filename and timestamp)
- Updates `assets` table with `is_google_favorite = true` for matching records

## üìå Step 3.2 ‚Äì Manual Curation via Google Photos App

After uploading a full month of photos to Google Photos, wait for the auto-curated **Memory Collection** to appear (e.g., ‚ÄúBest of March 2025‚Äù). These are not Albums and are not accessible via API.

Use the Google Photos app (mobile or web) to view the generated Memories, and ‚≠êÔ∏è mark your favorite photos manually. These starred photos will later be retrieved via API in the next step (3.3) for export, curation, and cleanup.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Step 3.3 (`sync_photos_assets.py`) is optional and is used primarily for pre-upload filtering, scoring analysis, or offline reporting. It is not required for the standard pipeline flow.

# ‚ú® Notes

- **Manual Smart Album creation**: AppleScript cannot create Smart Albums ‚Äî must be manually created before export.
- **Dry-run mode**: Available in critical scripts like verification and uploads.
- **Orphan Handling**: Orphaned folders will be renamed, _not deleted_ immediately.
- **Failure recovery**: Pipeline designed to be safe, resumable, and auditable at each stage.

TODO: Start to think how to handle the reupload of the same month - either because assets count has been changed or because more space is availble on the drive
- in upload scropt - if current status is 399 need to reset the list of uploaded files like 2025-05
